‘BelialL-Pembridge says that this son of
Belial was killed in Leix ‘⁶ sieut bene meruit?
as he well deserved. The word “ interficitur‚'’
by the error of the transeriber, has been trans-
ferred in the MS. from this to the preceding
entry.

g Gulielmus Longaspanta.-William Long
Espee was killed in the battle of Massoura

1260.

in Egypt, when St. Louis was taken prisoner
in his fatal attempt upon Cairo, the Babylon
of the middle ages. It appears from M.
Paris that a false report of the capture of
Cairo at this time had reached Europe, as
had also been the case in 1167, when Grace
erroneously reeords its capture by Almarie,
King of Jerusalem.

”Illae Karti.-Hanmer, p. 400, quoting
Clinne, places this defeat of the Geraldines
at 1260. It is notieed by Pembridge very
briefly at 1261.

i Fitz Gerot.-There is great confusion in
the entries for this and the following years.
The events,which are given eolleetively under
this date, being mentioned separately under
the years 1259, 1261, and 1264. These An-
nals were carelessly compiled from different
authorities, all of them, unhappily, sufficiently
meagre.
