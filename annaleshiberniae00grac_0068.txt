λ Pal-limuentum.—This parliament was held

cation‚ February 3. The names ofthe nobles

Ed. II. 45. The)v are printed in the ap-
pendix to these Annals. From another enti-y
we learn the course ofproceedings in this par-
liament. which Prvnne erroneously thinks
was the first held in lreland after the time of
Hen. ΙΙ. and the Statutes then enacted. The

sheriff ofevery eounty was to send two knights

cim-5 and the council of the king, and with
the lords of the land, and to make and sanc-
tion orders then ordained. When met, at the
suggestion of the Justiciary, lest the whole
body in times of such scarcity should be bur-
dened with the consideration of such weighty
matters, the parliament elected two bishops
and two other prudent men, John de Barry
and Eustace le Poer, and these four from the
whole body, including themselves, chose six-
teen, who with the assent of all were best able
to find a remedy in the premises. These six-
teen, whose names are given in the roll, with
the consent of the Justiciary, ofthe council of
the king. and of the parliament, made the fol-
lowing Statutes: 1. That, whereas the chief
cause of the high price of provisions arises
from the robberies committed by persons of
noble birth, every noble should take upon
himself the punishment of his own followers.
2. That there be appointed in every count),⁴
six good men or more, who, with the sheriff
and the coroner, should inquire after malefac-
toi-s, and punish and imprison them. 3. That

having arms for keeping the peace, he pro-
claimed‚ and firmly observed. 4. Of not
