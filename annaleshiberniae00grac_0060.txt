lVogan had letters ofcredence respecting the

vol. i. p. 9:38. The list there given is the most
complete list extant of the Irish gentry at the

In Lynch's Feudal Dignities, p. 100, two in-
quisitions are referred to, of the years 15:38
and 1550, in which it is stated that the Wol-
lesleys held the inanor of Dengin of the. king
as of his inanor of Triin hy grand sergeancy,
viz.. by bearing the standard of the lord the
king in his wars in Ireland. There are some
difficulties about this interesting fact, which it
1511111011110001011111111 Mr. Lynch did not notice:
1. The W'ellesleys are descended froin the
standard Bearer of Heni-y II. (see inscription
on monument at Lai-acor, County Meath), but
the Cusakes were in possession ofDengin in the
time of Richard II. (Rot. Pat. 4 R. IL), and
it would be an extraordinary coincidence that
the descendants of Henry ll.'s standard bearer
should inherit in the fourteenth century anianor
to which that office was attached. 2. As Dengin
was in the Palatinate of Meath, it requires
some explanation to account how it happened

that it was held not of the Lord of Meath‚
but of the king, and held of the manor of
Trini, which then belonged to the Archbishop
of Arinagh. The glories of the present Wel-
lesleys make every thing interesting which is
connected with their adopted name which is
now inemorable for ever.
