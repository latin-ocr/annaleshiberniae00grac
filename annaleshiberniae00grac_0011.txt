01 Ireland, as confirming, explaining, or c‹)ntrzulicting the 51111611161115 of
the annalist, and occasionally as supplying some of his omissions, will
not be considered altogether useless.

The MS, which is on paper, consists 01 thirty-eight small folio pag-es,
all, except one, written in the same hand. The regular Annals termi- .
nate at 1370, from which date the entries 60115151 chiefly of the Obits
of the Lacys and Burkes from 1 326 to 1 5 1 5, and although in the 5111116
hand, and written with ink of the same 6010111 with the Annals, and
carried on on the same page, they are entered in a very confused man-
1161; 111656 1116 followed by the Obits 01 1116 Butlers 111 chronological
order, which are succeeded by the Obits 01 the Geraldines, 111 a dif-
ferent hand, and paler ink. The last leaf 011116 MS, which has been
misplaced in the binding, gives some account 01 1116 Lord Leonard
Gray, Lord Deputy in 1 53 5, and has been restored to its proper chro-
nological place in the printed text.

The reader is requested to correct note q, p 29, in which the com-
piler 01 111656 Α11111115 15 accused 01 having been mistaken in asserting
that Hubert de Burgh was Justiciary 01 Ireland in 1230. In 11115
61156 1116 mistake was made by the Editor, as it appears from Rot. Pat.
16 Hen. III. in Tur. Lond. ; and also 110111 1116 Book 01 Howth, 115
quoted by Hanmer, that Hubert de Burgh was Lord Justice 01 116-
land in 1 230.

From many friends the Editor has received much assistance. but
as this assistance cannot be specified in every instance, their names
are omitted, lest they should be thought responsible 101· 1116 11115111κ65
011116 Editor; he cannot, however, forbear acknowledging, that 101·
