should make no attack before his coming.

But in the mean time Bruce was

warncd ol' his coming and to ‹lepart thence, and thc following night hc moved

towards Kildarc‚ but 1110 English went back to their own country, and the army

to the Kingin 1316, it was represented to him
by the people of Ireland, that the law was,
that an Englishman convicted of the murder
of an Englishman, of robbery, of arson, 01 of
stealing to the value of mid„ should suffer
capitally, and that the same punishment should
be inflicted upon an Irishman convicted of the
murder of an Englishman, or of arson3 but
that an Irishman convicted of robbery 01
theft was at the diseretion of the judge, either
to be put to death, or to commute his punish-
ment by the. payment of money. The peti-
11011915, not complaining of the advantage thus
given to the Irish criminal, stated that as lo'ng
as this law was observed‚ the English people
increased, and the Church enlarged its bounds,
but that the justices had assumed the power of
coininuting felonies for little or nothing, charg-
ing for the murder of an Englishman, for rob-
bery or thest, 100 pounds, or 140 01· 20 shsslings,
and that these slight punishments had given
such courage to felons, both English and Irish,
that they were not afraid to commit the most
dreadful crimes, especially as the king’s true
subiects were afraid toindict 01 10 convict such
felons, fearing that when discharged on the
payinent of these penalties, they would mur-
der or ruin them for their verdicts. The
remedy proposed for these evils was, that the
murder of an Englishman, or arson, should not
fon the future be pardoned or commuted for
except in parliament, which should be held
every year 3 that these crimes should not be
connnuted for less than AElOO, nor robbery
and theft for 1955 than four times the value to
be paidinto the Exchequer before the prisoner

of

should be discharged from gaol. The king
referred the matter to a meeting of all the
prelates, barons, and 001111110115, for their
opinion, rcserving the decision to himself.—

very curious paper is given in the Appendix.
The specific grievances arising from the ob-
servance of the Irish rather than of the Eng-
lish law, when it pressed upon the Irish‚ are
given in the Memoirs of Charles O’Conor,
p. 72, and in Moore’s Hist. of Ireland, vol.
iii. p. 75, from the Remonstrance of the Irish
to Pope John X XII.‚ a document which Ι have
not seen in the original.

The following entry shows that there was
a peculiarity either in the law or the mode
of administering it in Ireland, 10 which the
Anglo-Irish were attached, and which they
were unwilling should be changed: “ Rex.
