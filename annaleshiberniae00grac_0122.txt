⁵ Episcopo &somenam-June Is, 1329, the
king complained to the Pope that Richard,
Bishop of Ossory, who was bound by his office
to promote peace and allay angry and vindic-
tive passiom, had fomented feuds and dissen-
sions ainongst the nobles of Ireland‚ “ac quae-
dam alia in nostri praejudicium attemptare
11011 expavit, quae ad praesens ob certas causas
subticenius‚'’ and when inquii-y was about to be
made into his conduct by the king's officers in
Ireland‚ had privately fied from that country,
as if conscious of guilt, and had come to the

mata

king in England, and when summoned to ap-
pear before the king and council had secretly
sailed away, unmindful of his oath of alle-
giance. The king therefore, learning that
the hishop had grievously disturbes] the peace
of Ireland, and that he proposed to go to the
Pope, and under the veil of piety to make
some suggestions to his Holiness for the pur-
pose of exciting the Irish people, entreats the
Pope not to believe his representations against
his faithful suhjects, or the statenients of the
condition of Ireland, which the bishop ma)v
make, ‘⁶ quasi ex zelo religionis seu fidei ortho-
doxae 011111 profecto ad hoc ejus intentio nulla-
tenusdirigatur.’'--Rymer5 vol. ii. p. 767. Did
the bishop intend to charge the government of
Ireland with heresy ’Β 111 1339, he was, in his
turn, accused of heresy by his metropolitan,
Arc-libishop Bykenor‚ and was driven to shelter
himself under an appeal to the Apostolic See.—
