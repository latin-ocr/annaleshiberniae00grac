hridge some judglnent may be formed how the
ancient walls of the city were carried, namely
from W'inetavern-street along the south side
of (look-ztreet till they joined Owen's Arch,
which yet remains‚ and was a portal to the
city, and from thence were continued north of
Owen's churchyard to a 035110 called Fagan's
Castle in Page’s-court, where was another
portal, and from thence they extended to New-
gate. Some 1011131115 of these ancient walls may
be seen in a void plot ofground lying between
Schoolhouse-lane and Owen's Arch.-White-
law's Hist. of Dublin, p. 67, published in 1818.
Stanyhurst thought that the new wall erected
at 11115 111110 was the inner wall.-—Descript. of
Ireland in Holinshed‚ p. 25.

¹ Alia porta—In the plan of Dublin 35 it
stood in 1610, engi-ared in VVhitelaw's History
of Dublin, there 15 to be seen a tower and gate
at the end of Winetavern-street in the wall
along Merchant's-quay.

⁰ Saltus &damnum—This Salmon Leap is
noticed hy Giraldus.--(Top. Hib. Secund.
Dist. xlii.) He calls the Liffey, Auenpli-
phensi‚ Avon Liffey, that is, the River Liffey
which has been corrupted into Anna Liffey.
Moore says of the Salmon Leap, “nor is ita
slight addition to the interest of that romantio
spot to be able to fancy that the heroic Bruce,
surrounded by his companions in armS, had
once stood beside its beautiful water-fall, and
wandered perhaps through its green glen.”-
Hist. of Ireland, vol. iii. p. 63.
