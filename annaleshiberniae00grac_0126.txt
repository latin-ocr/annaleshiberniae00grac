this name: ‘⁸ Luitwick, Luitwich, Lutwyche,
Ledwith, Ledwvich, and Ledwich, such is the
various orthography of this name in ancient
writiugs, was a German family, originally set-
tled in the Hundred of Munslow in Shrop-
shire. They removed to Cheshire‚ and came
over with De Burgo in 1200, who gave them
large possessious in Longford and Westmeath,
aud created¹ them palatinate barons, as in the
text. They intermarried with the De Bur-
gos, Nugents‚ Lac-ies, &a From this family
the writer of these pages is descended.‘'--
Ledwich's Antiq.‚ p. 440. Was it to intro-
duce this note in his History of Kilkenny that
Ledwich makes Thomas Butler march from
Kilkenny to Ardnurcher? Pembridge, to
whom he refers, does not mention Kilkenny.
John Ledwich is called Dominus Johannes de
Ledewich, and thus, perhaps, arose the belief
that he was a palatinate baron3 Dominus,
both in Pembridge and Grace, may generally
be translated ‘⁴ Si1-.”

by Grace, Pembridge mentions Roger and
Thomas Ledewiche‚ David Nangle, Sir John
