Purification (Feb. 2) 1317.--Rymer, vol. ii.
pp. 301, 5, 9. 111 Mortimer's commission
power was given to him “ concedendi Hiber-
nicis quod ipsi legibus Anglicanis utantur et
gaudeant, prout pro . . . . expeditione negotio-
rum nostrorum in partibus 11115 contra Scotos
inimicos et rebelles nostros, qui eandem terram
hostiliter ingressi sunt 3 melius videbitur faci-
enda.’' Perhaps the coldness with which he
was received by the Irish lords, and their want
ofcooperation with him, may have been caused
by his attempt to exercise this power, and to
extend the laws of England to the natives of
Ireland3 a privilege long coveted by the Irish,
and which the kings of England were always
willing to grant.-Rymer, vol. i. pp. 498, 540,
582 3 vol. ii. p. 812. From such startling en-
tries as the following it would appear that the
king could not give this privilegev to an indi-
vidual without the consent of his master. Rex,
de assensu et voluntate Henrici de Cogan con-
cessit Johanni O Kaskyn, Hibernico ejusdem
Henrici, quod ipse et ejus exitus lege Angli-
cana utantur.-Rot. Pat. 11 Ed. 11. 170. It
may be observed‚ that the great Anglo-Irish
lords had a direct interest in excluding their
Irish tenants from the protection of the Eng-
lishlaw ; over their English tenants theycould
legally exercise no powers but such as were
exercised in England, but over their Irish
tenants they claimed, and were legally entitled
to, all the privileges which had been exercised
by the Irish princes. Of these Irish princes
they considered themselves as the rightful re-
presentatives, either by blood, as in the whole
of Leinster ; or by the ternis of their charters,

as in the province of Meath 3 and so careful

triaverunt

were they of obtaining a legal right to the
exercise of the Irish law, that when Kildare
was granted to Thomas Fitz John, he had
granted to him a retrospective power of pun-
ishing all former offences according to the
laws and customs of Ireland.—Rot. Pat. 11
Ε11. ΙΙ. 57. The ericks, and money com-
mutations for felonies, the bonaghts and
cosherings, and cuddies, and the other dues
of the Irish chief (enumerated by Ware,
Antiq.‚ c. xii.)‚ however injurious to the
people, were all profitable to the lord, who
was therefore not only willing to continue
them over his Irish tenant, but was also desi-
rous of introducing them over his English
freeholders. The question in fact was, not
between the Crown and the subject, but be-
tween the lord and the vassal‚ whether the
latter should be governed according to the
law of the English settlers, or by the old 65-
tablished laws and customs of Ireland. But
although it would be difficult to prove that the
English lords exacted any dues, or exercised
any powers, over their Irish tenants, which
were not levied and exercised at the same
times by the Irish chiefs in the Irish countries
(see Sir J. Davis' letter to Lord Salisbury),
still it must be concluded that these exactions
were levied with greater harshness and paid
with greater reluctance in the English dis-
tricts, than in those in which landlord and
tenant were of the same blood, and where
there were no invidious distinctions to make
subjection to them a proof ofinferiority. Nor
was the Irish law injurious only to the Irish,
the English also suffered from the introduc-

11011 of some of its principles. In a petition
