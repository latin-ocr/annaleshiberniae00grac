men contributing to the subsidy should be
ipso facto deprived of their benefices, and ren-
dered ineapable of obtaining promotion within
the province3 that their lay tenants contribu-
ting should be exconunuuicated, and their
children, to the third generation, rendered
incapahle of holding any Church prefer-nient

decrees the archbishop and the bishops came
to Cloninel, and on Thursday after the Puri-
ficatimr, February 9, in their pontifical robes,

nicated all those who granted or advised said

Clomnel, and had cited him to appear before
him at a certain day to answer articles relating

he exeommunicated him, buthe denied that he

ing the subsidy. The archhishop and the
