⁸ Universitas.-This was the great era of
literary foundations. Five colleges were
founded at Oxford between 1250 and 1350.
lt was the era of Dante and Petrarch and
()cc1nn3 and Archbishop Bykenor, who, as
an high ecclesiastic and as a statesman, was
brought into connexion with the. first men of
his age, was naturally anxious to give to his
adopted country some share in that literature
which was then spreading over Europe.

The Church of St. Patrick's was collegiate
from its foundation, and its founder, Arch-
bishop Comyn, intended that it should be a
model for the instruction of the clergy of Ire-
land. The words of the preamble to his

foundation chartei· are, ‘⁶ Johannes cum

Appendix‚ No. l.

In 1310, Clement the Fifth‚ on the petition
of Archbishop John de Leeke‚ stating that
although there were in Ireland some doctors‚
or at least bachelors oftheology, who gave lec-
tures‚ yet in that country and in the parts of
Scotland, Man, and Norway, which were near
it, there was no university or general place of
study (generale studium), on which account
few men of learning were to be found there,
ordained, that if the suffragans of the Arch-
bishop gave their consent, there shmld be in
the city of Dublin a university, “ et in qualibet
scientia et facultate licita de cetero Studium
gene1·ale‚” with power of reading lectures and
of conferi-ing doctors' degi·eeS.—Bulla Uni-
versitatis Dublin, ut snpra, No. vii.

Leelze died in 1313, and left the honour of
opening the University of Dublin to his suc-
cessor Bykenor, whose ‘⁶ ordinatio pro Uni
versitate Dublinienss' is given in the sanie nuni-
ber ofthe appendix, and is translated in Harris'
VVare's Antiq.‚ pp. 243, 244. In this ordi-
nance the archbishop reserved to himself and
his successors the right of appointing as lec-
turer on the Scriptures any regent in theo-
logy, whether secular, or regular of any order
