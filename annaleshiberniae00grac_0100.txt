‘¹ Ad nativitatem-The earl had been libera-
ted on hailon the 81111(111)’1101”01·0 Ascension
Thursday, May 8, and was bound 10 appear
on St. John's day. On the Monday after
St. John’s day he was liberated finally, 011
taking the oaths stated, and giving securi-
1105. This may be reconciled with the pre-
ceding entry, in which the ear] 15 said not to
have come at the day appointed, by supposing
that he was bound before St. John‘s day, either
to take. legal proceedings against the citizens
or to surrender himself, and that he chose
the latter. On the 27111 of April, the king,
by writ to Mortimer, reserved to himself the
consideration of all things touching the arrest
of the Earl of Ulster‚ Gilbert, and Hugh de
Burgh and Henry 10 Clerk.-Ry1ner, vol. ii.
p. 327. On the 23rd July, the earl had letters
of safe conduct on his way to England, and
on the following day he had letters of protec-
tion.—Rot. Pat. ll Ed. II. 4, 7.

of the castle of Carl·icl<fergus‚ at a salary of
100 marks per an. 3 and in 1335 he was admi-
ral “flote Regis omnium naviuin in singulis
portubus et aliis locis in Hibernia.''-R0t. Cl.
9 & lo Ed. III. 33. Perhaps the Mandevssles,
who had defended Cal-rickfergus‚ thought
that the castle should be confided to them,
for, in 1319, Richard de Mandeville be-
sieged it when in the keeping of John de
Athy.--Rymer, vol. ii. p. 388.

⁸ Thomam Dum—Dr. Drummond, in his
notes to Bruce's Invasion, conjectures, that
this Thomas Don was the *ί Thomas off
Downex’ “ a scowmar off the se‚” who freed
Edward Bruce and his army from their ι100-
pal-dy on the banks of the Banu, by ferrying
them across in four vessels, as told by Bar-
bour.-B. xiv. l. 375.
