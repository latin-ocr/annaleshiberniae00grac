agree also frequently with the accounts given
in the Anglo-Norman poem 011 the Conquest
of Ireland, erroneously ascribed to Maurice
Regan. From Giraldus de Reb. de se gestis,
pars 11, cap. xx, printed in Anglia Sacra, it

the Proem 2ae Editionis Hib. Expug. it also
appears that he desired and expected that
that work should be turned into French.
For a beautiful edition of the Conquest of
Ireland we are indebted to Francisque Michel.

indicabo.’' See also Bib. Stowens, vol. i. p. 209.
