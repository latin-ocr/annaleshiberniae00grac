In 1358 the clerks and scholars of Ireland
petitioned Edward III. for protection, de-
claring that they could no longer go to foreign
parts for learning, on account of their poverty
and of the dangers of the sea, and thattheypro-
posed, “legere et audire’' in the city of Dub-
lin, theology. civil law, the sacred canons and
the other cleric-al sciences. The king granted
the petition‚ and took under his protection all
masters, scholars, and clerks, and their ser-
vana, from whatever parts coming to said
city for such purpose and staying there, ‘⁶ quia
ubi hujusmodi Studium tenetruz sacra praedi-
catur scriptura, et auditores inde a viciis se
retrahentes, moribus sanctis atque virtutibus

It appears, however, from various licenses

In Mason's St. Patrick’s, p. 124, it is stated
that in 1364 Lionel D. of Clarence granted
to the Dean and Chapter of St. Patrick’s an
acre of land at Stachallane (stac-kasseu), and
the advowson of the church, to pay 10 marks
per annum to a person of the Order of St.

Archbishop Bykenore's University dwindled
away for want of funds. Some vestiges of it
remained in the reign of Henry VIL, for in
a provincial Synod held in Christ Church
before Arebbishop Walter Fitz Simons, in
1496, certain annual pensions‚ amounting al-
