of Ulster camo to Naas. Messcngers are sent to the King about the state ol'
Ireland. Roger Mortimcr and the lords deliberate at Kilkenny how they should
act towards Bruce, but nothing was dotermincd. In the month after Eastcr,
Bruce came to within sour miles ofTrim, and there encamped in a certain wood,
and staid sevcn days to refresh his men, who had nearly perished of hunger and
fatigue, and many wcrc left there dead. On the day of St. Philip and St. James
(May 1) he went towards Ulster. A short time after Mortimer with John Wogan
came to Dublin with Fitz WVarin and thirty knights, and held a parliament at
Kihnainham with all the nobles, in which they treated of the liberation of the
Earl of Ulster; nothing was concluded. At a second meeting in Dublin he is
liberated under hail, having given hostages and an oath that 116 would not injure
the citizens of Dublin, a day is fixed for tlte trial, but at that day he did not
return. A great scarcity of wheat3 the crannock was worth 2452, oats 163„ wine
Sd„ for the whole country was wasted by the Ulster men and the Scots3 many
of the rich men became beggars, and many died of hunger, there also raged a
horrible plague which carried off numbers. At Whitsuntide, Mortimer, the
Justiciary, betook himself to Drogheda, and from that place to Trim, he calls
before him the Lacies by 1611615, they refused to 601116, and then the Lord Hugh
de Custes, Knight, is sent to them to treat with them of peace, and is put to death
by them. Therefore Mortimer assemblcd an army and spoiled them ofgoods
and cattle, and slew many of their followers, and drove 1116111 11110 Connaught;
but Walter Lacy is said to have gone to Ulster to seek aid from Bruce. At a

¹¹ Constituitnr dies.-1t appears more plainly
from Pembridge that the earl swore that he
would notinj ure the citizens, but would proceed
against them by law3 and it would seem that
for that purpose time was given him to St.
John‘s day (June 24), on which day he did
not appear.

says 233.‚⁸Holinshed 24s.; from many such
coincidences it is likely that Cox consulted
Pembridge, and Holinshed (Campion) con-

sulted Flattsbury or Grace. In 1316 in Eng-
land, before St. John's day (June 24), wheat
was 303. the quar-ter, and from St. John's day
to Lady Day in harvest (August 15) was 40s.

Pemb. Pexnbridge does not say that he was
murdered by the Lacies, his words are, ·‘ et
postea Dominus Hugo de Croftes Miles missus
fuit ad les Laeyes, et bona sua et animalia et
thesaurum cepit, et ipsos omnino destruxit
et plures de eorum hominibus occidit et eos
fugavit in partibus Connaciae.
