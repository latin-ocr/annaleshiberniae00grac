“Edwardus Primus.-E dward the First was
not King before 1272. In 1245 Henry III.
invaded Wales, and summoned Maurice Fitz-
geram, J usticiary of Ireland, to his aid, but
he was so long coming, although the wind was
fair, that the King was displeased, and re-
moved him from the governinent, appointing
John Fitz-Geffrey Justiciary η 111 his room.

of his son which soon followed made him think
lightly of earthly dignity.—(M. Paris, ad an.
1245). Campion (p. 112) endeavours to
smooth away the difficulty by calling Edward,
not Kins-s, but Prince3 but in 1245 Edward
was only six years old. The original proba-
bly read only Rex, and Edward Primus was
supplied by the transcriber. None of these
events are mentioned in Pembridge.

and besought Henry III. that he would not
allow his true liege man (suum fidelem) who
paid 5000 marks annually for his kingdom, to
be dispossessed by that ignoble stranger, John
de Burgh. The king ordered Maurice Fitz-
Gerald, Justiciary‚ who was in his presence,
to root out the barren fig tree (sycomorum in-
fructuosam) planted in Connaught by Hubert
de Burgh in the madness of his power, and
not to suffer it to shoot forth.—(Matt. Paris
in anno). In the last edition of Rymer, vol. i.
p. 240, there is a letter from Felim O'Cono-
hur, King of Connaught, to Henry ΙΙΙ., thank-
ing him for the many favours which he had
conferred upon him, and especially for his
having written in his behalf against Walter
de Burgh to his J usticiary William Dene,
and requesting that, as Dene had died before
he received the king's letter, a like letter
should be written to his successor, Richard
de Rupella. This letter is given by Rymer
