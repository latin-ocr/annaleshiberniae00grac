Γ In pugilem.-Leland (Hist. of Ireland,
vol. i. p. 1753) and Lodge (Peerage, Kin-
sale) discredit this story. Hoveden (Annal
Pars Post.) says that John de Curcy was
treacherously imprisoned by Hugh de Lacy,
iu one of whose castles he had taken refuge
from the attacks of Walter de Lacy, but that

tages to surrender himself when called upon;

Courey, took him, put him 111 irons, and made
himself master of Ulster3 he afterwards let
him go free 3 when John went to King Ronald
of Man, who received him honorably as a re-
lation, for De Courcy had married Godred's
daughter Africa. 1205. John de Courcy‚
recruiting his forces, got together a great
army, and brought Ronald with near 100
