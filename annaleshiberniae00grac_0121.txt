Edward III. had directed a writ to the 111511-
ciary and Chaneellor of Ireland, “qui nunc
sunt, vel qui pro tempore erunt vel eorum lo-
cum tenentilms,'' stating that James le Botiller
of Ireland had claimed the prisage os wine in
Ireland, “unde cognomen suum gerit, 01 ipse
et antecessores sui de tempore, quo 11011 extat
memoria, gerebant, viz. de qualibet navi vinis
venalibus 0111011111 1111 civitates Dublin, Drothda
Waterford, Cork et Lymeryk veniente, unum
dolium vini ante malum, et unum aliud retro,
pro quadraginta solidis 11101011101111115, quorum
vina illa fuerint, solvendis.” The king orders
this prisage to be restored, if it was taken into
his father's hands on the death of Edmund le
Botiller, and if not, orders inquiry.—-R5mer‚
vol. ii. p. 695.

From the deprecatory 101101· directed to
James le Botiller‚ and dated July, 1327 (see
note v. p. 104), it may be conjectured that
J ames Butler's petition had been addressed to
