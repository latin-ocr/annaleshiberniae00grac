‘¹ BIeZZifontense.-Mellifont‘ in the county of
Louth. Almost all the abbeys whose founda-
tion is mentioned in these Annals belonged to
the Cistercians, which seems to indicate that
the Annals were originally compiled in a Cis-
tercian house, probably 81. Mary’s, Dublin.
Thirteen Cistercian Abbots were Lords of
l'arliament. Mellifont was the first and chief
ahbey in Ireland, and the Abbot had prece-
‹lence in Parliament before all Abbots of all
orders. In the Statutes of the. Cistercians‚
printed by Martene, in the fourth volume of
the Thesaurus Anecdotorum there are seve-
ral 11011005 (if 11115 and the other Irish 11011505
of 1110 order, which have not been quoted by
Arehdall. Although it. may make a long
note we may mention some of them. At a
general Chapter held in 1190, the Abbots of
Ireland had lieense to absent themselves from
the Chapter for three years, and to attend the

missioned so to arrange their turns that some
‹›f them might attend every year. Notwith-

of Clairvaux, who was empowered to substi—

In 1275 1110 Abhot of Mellifont petitioned the
Chapter that there might be a commemora-
tion of St. Malaohy, St, Patrick, and St.
Brigid, in Horis S. Mariae, in all houses de-
seended from Mellifont. With regard to the
national distinctions so unhappily introduced

Cox, who states, from a record in 1110 Tower
of Lonclon, of 1321, that no person was ad-
mitted into the Ahbey of Mellifont unless he
made oath that he was not of English descent,
(Hib. Anglicana, p. 100); the Chapter in 1323
expresses its detestation of such damnable di-
vision, introduced hythe enemy of the human
race, and warns all Abbots, and especially
those of Ireland, ofwhom grievous complaints
had been made, that they should remove 511011
walls of separation, an‹11in‹.1ifferently admit all

complained to the Pope that the Irish refused
to admit Englishmen into their monasteries.
(Rymer, vol. ii. p. 554). Andi111337 Edw.111.
says that his father (probably finding that
neither the Chapter nor the Pope had suc-
ceeded in remov‘mg the prejudice against the
English from the Irish monks) had ordered
that no Irishman should be admitted into any
English monastery, but had afterwards re-
voked the order, and he now orders that all
