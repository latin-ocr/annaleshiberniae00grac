give hostagcs for peace. Thence the J usticiary went to Trim, where John White
of Rathregan was accuscd and fined two hundred marks. After the Nativity os
Mary (September 8) he went with an army towards Imayle‚ and came to Hy-
Kinselagh where many fell, both English and Irish‚ but the English were vie—
torious. Murrogh O'Birne surrendered himself to the king at thc Castle of
Dublin; then the Archbolds bound themselves to the peace, the Earl of Kildare
giving security for them. The Archbishop of Dublin and the Earl of Ulster
