are generally ascribed to Christopher Pembridge, who lived in the

and the constant difference in their language, suggest the probability,
that they were both compiled from some connnon original.

The best evidence which can now be given for attributing these Anna-ls
to Grace is derived from the title prefixed to them, which, although
in'a hand 111016 modern than the MS. itself‚ appears to have* had the
sanction of Archbishop Ussher, 111 whose autograph the name of
‘⁴ <lanies Grac& is written over the title. ’
