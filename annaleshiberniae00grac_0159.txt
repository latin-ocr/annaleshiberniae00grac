shortly asterwards3 he was a good man and just, who hanged even his own rela-

tions for theft, and well chastised the Irish.
1 3 56. Thomas Rokcby is made J usticiary the second time, a just and prudent

publicly proclaimed in every county, as well
within the liberties as without, and in cities,
bomnghs, and mai-ket towns, and that com-
missions should be issued under the Great
Seal for the punishment of all delinquen ts. He
also ordered that all commissions to purvey-
ors should be sealed with the Great Seal alone,
and that nothing whatever should be taken
under the Seal of the Justiciary or any other
officer3 and he declares that he will punish
any Justiciary or other officer, purveyor, &c.‚
who will act contrary to this writ.—Rymer‚
vol. iii. p. 340. The natm-e and consequences
ofthese exactions are noticed in the preamhle
osa Statute which shows that the king's officers
were not the only offenders in this case, (10
Hen. VII. c. 4, not printed‚) which states,
‘⁶ that of long time there hath been used and
exacted by the lords and gentlemen of this
land, many and divers damnable customs and
usages, which being called coin and livery and
pay, that is horse meat and man's meat for the
finding of their horsemen and footmen, and
over that, 4d. or δά. daily to every of them, to
be had and paid of the poor earth-tillers and
tenants without anything· doing or paying
therefor. Resides many murders, robberies,
rapes, and other manifold oppressions by the
said horsemen and footmen daily and nightly
committed and done, which have been the
principa] causes of the desolation and destruc-

man,

lands, whereupon the foresaid lorsls and gen-
tlemen of this land have intruded into the
said freeholders and tenants’ inheritances‚
and the same keepeth as their own, and set-
teth under them in the same land the king's
Irish enemies, to the diminishing of Holy
Church's rites‚ the deser-tion of the king and
his obedient subjects, and the utter ruin and
desolation of the land.⁷' -- Davis’ Discovery‚
pp. 143, l44; see also cc. xviii and xix, 10
Hen. VII. in printed Statute.

In Baron Finglas's Breviate it is proposed
that if the deputy draw any Irishman to any
hosting they have livery the night going and
another coming, and that at such coin and
livery every chief horse have twelve sheaves
of cats, and every hackeney or other bearing·
horse eight sheaves, and that there be but one
boy to a horse. ‘⁶ Item—that all souche soo
livered shall take souche meat and drink as
the husbandman haith, so that that be compe-
tent meat and drinke, and if they will not re-
ceive such meat and drinke as they find, then
every horseman to have a meal but Qd. every
galloglass, kearn, and boy oone penny, and if
it be flesh daye to have but oone manner of
flesh sodden, without anie rost, and but bread
and butter‚ and alsoo boys and footemen,
except Sondayes.” He also proposed, that
there should be no herbenger within the four
shires, except the king’s, and that he seal no

tion of the said land, so as the most part of bill but such as shallbe sealed with the sign of

the English freeholders and tenants be de-

the horse-head—Har. Hibernica, pp. 93, 94.

par-ted out of the land, some into the realm VVas the Herbenger's seal of the horse’s head
of England, and other some to other strange the origin of the sign of the nag's head?
