³1345.-In 1:344, for which year there is
110 enti-y either in Pembridge or Grace, the
king issued a writ, on the l4th of June, to
Ralph de Ustbrd, ι1051101011, directing him to
inquire “per sacramentum proborum et le-
galium hominum tam infra libertates quam
extra,⁷' what lands and tenements had been
granted by the king-'s ancestors for 1110 defence
of the marches between 1110 English and the
Irish, and in what way the tenants had 0011-

who were to receive the king's pay, and who
were to serve the king in his war with Philip of
Valois 3 atthe same time Maurice Fitz Thomas,
Earl of KHdare, Fuleo 110 la Freigne (now
Freney), Edinund de Bul-gh, Walter de Bir-
mingham, Richard Tuyt, and David Barry,
were likewise summoned to bring twenty men
at arnis andtiftyhobelars. Gerald de Rochef'
(Roohefort), Eustace Power, Milo de Coucy
(de Courcy), the Lord of Anri (Athenry), and
the Captain de Rocheyns (Roehes), were sum-
moned with ten men at arms and thirty ho-
belars.-Rymer, vol. iii. pp. 13, 17. Their
neglect of this 5010111005 must have irritated
the king against these lords‚ and brought
on them the punishment of the following

year. It is, however, to be notice-d that in
