rice Fitz Thomas, Earl of Kildare, was ap—
pointed Justiciary. - Rymer, vol. iii. p. 326.
On the 26th of July, Thomas de Rokeby, who
had been appointed J usticiary, was on his way
to Ireland, as it would seem, with a considera-
ble number of followers. There were two
Thomas RokebyS, distinguished from each
other as l’Uncle and le Neveu.—-Rymer, vol.
iii. p. 332. On the *20ch of April, in conse-
quence of the invasion threatened by the Lein-
ster rebels with the aid of a great multitude
of other Irish‚ a royal hosting (regale ser-
vicium) at Neweastle M‘Kynegan was pro-
claimed through all Ireland, and the sheriffs
of Dublin, Meath, VVexfortL Connaught, Ros-
common, Louth, Waterford, the Cross of
Ulster, Kildare, Limerick, the Cross of Kil-
kenny, Carlow, Cork, the Cross of Tipperary,
and the Cross of Kerry, and the seneschals
of the liberties of Kerry, Ulster, Tipperary,
Meath‚ and Kilkenny, were ordered to pro-
claim it in their several bailiwicks.—-Rot. Cl.
29 et 30 Ed. III. 16, 17. On the 16th of
July, Thomas (Gfflard), Bishop of Kildare,
was ordered no longer to delay to denounce,
as publicly excommunicated, the Conghors and
Dymsys, who, with banners displayed, were
violating the peace of the Church and of the
king, by invading the county of Kildare within
the. bishop'sjurisdiction3 and who had there-
by according to the canons and the provincial
constitutions incurred, ipso facto, the sentence
of greater excommunication.—Rot. Cl. 29 et
30 Ed. III. 1:34.

for Rokeby to keep this resolution of paying
in money ; when he was Justiciary he was
obliged to borrow “ in magna necessitate
pro commodo Regis et maintenencia pacis‚''
0873 63. sd. from Nicholas, Bishop of Meath.
-Ron Cl. 32 Ed. III. 31. On the l·2th of
September, the king, probably at the sugges-
tion of Rokeby, issued a writ to the Justiciary
and Chancellor on the subject of the exac-
tions, which were afterwards called coyn and
livery. In this writ he states that he had pre-
viously sent statutes and ordinances into Ire-
land forbidding his purveyors and those of the
nobles, to take provisions from the subjects
except under a certain form and at a certain
price, and that he has learned ‘⁶ ex insinua-

the Justiciary, and other officers, are in the
habit of taking and carrying off without price
or tally, as well in churches and church sees,
as elsewhere, and chiefly from the poor, oxen,
cows, sheep, pigs, caponS, hens, chickens, fish,
wheat, barley, oats, straw, and litter, against
the will of the people, commonly without
giving any price or tally, or at most scarcely

extortion, from which the rich, who made pre-
sents to the officers, were saved, and the poor
were oppressed, the people ofthe whole land

their debts to the king, but were compelled to
go about begging, to the ruin of the country.
The king, therefore, ordered that the before-
mentioned statutes and ordinances should be
