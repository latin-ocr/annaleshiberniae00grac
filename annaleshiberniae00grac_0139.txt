Carrickfergus, in the twenty—sixth year ofhis age, 111 June. He had put to death
Richard de Bffl'gh’ his uncle, both for having insulted his wife, (nam interiora
radere docuerat pro more Hiberniae), and 101· other causes. The sister os this
Richard had married Sir «John Mandeville of Donnahir, and she ceased not to
1110110 him to 1110 revenge of her brother; therefore, on the Lord's day, when 110
was riding to a meeting from the Castle of Ardes [P] towards Carricktergus to
chureh, pereeiving that more servants of the Logans [Ρ] were with him than were
with the earl, when he was saying the morning prayers with him, he cleft his
head from behind with a sword3 upon hearing which the earl's wife with his
daughter fied straightway from Ulster into England. John Darcy, Justiciary,
going there, and defeating the murderers in battle, takes some of them, and slew

others. The J usticiary thence passed over with an army into Scotland to the king,

Sir Richard Mandeville, in revenge for his

Nova Villa by Pembridge. It was probably

the Castle of Newtown—Ards.
