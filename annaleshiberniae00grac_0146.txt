then sent were Friar John L’Archer, Prior
of Kihnuinham, and Thomas de Wogan. The
discontented lords asked then three questions:

man ignorant of war P—How a king's officer

their grievances‚ 31111 of the ill conduct ofthe
king's Officers, which is given at length from
Prynne's Collections in Lib. Hib.‚ pt. iv. p.
SQ. In this very interesting State Paper they
represent to the king, that. the third of Ire-
land, which had been conquered by his ances-
tors, had fallen into the hands of his Irish
enemies3 and that his faithful subjeets, the
English, were 50 impoverished that they could
scarcely live, ‘⁶ par grevance des ditz enemys

the treasurers did not pay their fees to 1116
constables without great (16(1116110115, although

treasurers paid constables, or at least charged
their fees in their accounts, where there were
no castles3 that provisions furnished in the
Scotch war had been charged to the king, but
not paid for. (These charges against the
treasurers would seem not to have. been un-
founded, for, in 1:344, Archhishop Bykenor,
as late treasurer, had pardon for sundryf‘alse
writs and acquittances, which he had put into
his treasurer’s account). The lords then re-
minded the king that in the time of rebellion

lish of Ireland “ se sont bien et loiahueut con-

their country, and this chiefly at their own
charge, and they pray that they henot ousted
