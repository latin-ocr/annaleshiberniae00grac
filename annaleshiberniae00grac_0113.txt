132 5. Riehard Ledred, Bishop of Ossory, cited Alice Ketil to clear herself
of heresy; she was convieted of magio, for it was surer proved that a certain
demon incubus (named Robin Artisson) had lain with her, to whom she had
offered 111110 red eocks, at a certain stone bridge at the eross roads3 and also at
prayer time between eompline and eursew, she swept the streets of Kilkenny
with brooms, and, as she swept, brought the dirt to the house of William 0111111117,
her son, where 5110 said, in conjurations, “ may all 1110 11101( of Kilkenny come
to this house.'' Many other women are found to have been partakers of this
impiety, 115 Petronilla of Meath‚ with her daughter Basilia. The bishop imposed
a fine upon her, and evompessed her 10 forswear witeheraft3 but afterwards, being
again convieted of the same crime, 5110 fled with Basilia, nor did she ever appear
again after that time. Petronilla ⁰f M ecztlz is burned at Kfflzenny, and as she was
dying she deelared that the before-named William deserved death as much as
she did, for that for a year and a day he had carried round 1115 naked body the
devil’s ἔ(31111110. Upon this, 110 was immediately taken by the order of the bishop,
and shut up in prison, where he was detained about two months3 there were
assigned to him two servants, who had orders to speak to him only 01100 a day,
and not to eat or drink with him3 at last he was set at liberty by the interest of
Arnold Power, Senesehall of Kilkenny. But to the same Arnold he gave a large
sum of money to throw the bishop into prison, whieh was done, and the bishop
was kept there three months. Amongst the goods of Aliee was found a Host‚ on
